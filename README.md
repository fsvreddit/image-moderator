A Dev Platform app for detecting AI content in images.

This app uses the Sightengine API to analyse ImageTrackList. To use, you need to sign up to [Sightengine's platform](https://sightengine.com/) and obtain an API user ID and key. You must set the API User in the app settings, and the API key via the subreddit context menu.

For smaller use cases, Sightengine's free tier will be adequate, permitting 100 AI detections per day up to 400/month. For higher usage needs, Sightengine offer paid plans.

## Checking images

Click on the post context menu for any post and choose "Check image for AI Content". If the post is an image post, it will be checked against SightEngine's API key and the likelihood of the post being AI generated will be shown as a popup.
