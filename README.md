A Dev Platform app for detecting AI content in images.

This app uses the SightEnngine API to analyse ImageTrackList. To use, you need to sign up to [SightEngine's platform](https://sightengine.com/) and obtain an API user ID and key.

For smaller use cases, SightEngine's free tier will be adequate, permitting 100 AI detections or 500 non-AI detections per month.
